This repository documents my journey through Linux labs and is a way for me to write my notes other than google docs
Each folder contains general knowledge and are typically put into my own words for later reference

## How I learn
1. Completing a lab via LabEx
2. Summarizing what I learnt inside my virtal machine running linux
3. Commit it to my repository on GitHub so I can have a tangible record of growth

## Goals
- I want to build familiarity with Linux internals
- I want to do so repeatedly and make it a goal to push commits either daily or every other day
- I eventually want to branch into understanding networking and homelabbing
